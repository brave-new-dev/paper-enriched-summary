# Icon Placeholders

This directory contains placeholder icon files for the Arxiv PDF Saver extension.

For a production extension, you would need to create proper PNG icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these using any image editor or online icon generator.
The icons should represent a PDF document or download symbol to match the extension's functionality.

For now, the extension will work without these files, but Chrome may show a default icon.
